Outwatch Examples [![Join the chat][gitter-badge]][gitter-url] [![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-url]
===

Prerequisites
---
Examples in this project use scalajs-bundler, which requires npm, yarn, and webpack working locally.

Due to [this issue](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6818) in semantic-ui, you must be running a Nodejs v10.

TodoMVC and a simple Login/Register authentication form is implemented. Needs some improvement. [You can view the documentation and examples here](https://clovellytech.github.io/outwatch-examples/). 

TodoMVC
--

The TodoMVC site implemented in outwatch. Run

```
sbt> project outwatch-examples-directory
sbt> dev
```

to load the devserver with autoreloading.
