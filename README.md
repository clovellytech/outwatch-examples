Examples in this project use scalajs-bundler, which requires npm, yarn, and webpack working locally.

TodoMVC and a simple Login/Register authentication form is implemented. Needs some improvement. [You can view the documentation and examples here](https://clovellytech.github.io/outwatch-examples/).
